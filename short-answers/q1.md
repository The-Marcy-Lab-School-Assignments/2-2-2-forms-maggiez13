# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
The form's button has a type attribute of "submit," which triggers the default behavior of submitting the form data. The form likely uses the HTTP GET method, which appends form data to the URL when submitted (original form submissions). To prevent this and avoid the page refresh, switch the form's method to HTTP POST. 

However, the modern way would be to manage form submissions without leaving the page. Specifically, `event.preventDefault()` which halts the form submission's default behavior. Here, we can extract form using using the form's properties, such as `value` for most inputs and `checked` for checkboxes. After handling the data, we can reset the form with `form.reset()`.
