# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer
Labels are important for accessibility and usability purposes. Labels provide a textual description or title for form elements, making it easier for users to understand what each input field is for. It is especially useful for those using assistive technologies like screen readers. 

There are two ways to associate a label with an input: implicit and explicit association. 

In an implicit association, we wrap the input element inside the label element which creates an implicit association between the label and the input. 
```html
<label>
  Email: 
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
</label>
```

In an explicit association, we use the "for" attribute in the label element to explicitly associate it with the input element by specifying the ID of the input element. 

```html
<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email">
```

Both methods achieve the same result, but the explicit association provides more flexibility. For example, when the label and input are not directly adjacent in the HTML structure or when you want to associate a label with a specific input without nesting the input inside the label.
