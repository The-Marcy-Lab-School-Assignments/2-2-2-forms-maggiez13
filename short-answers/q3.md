# Question
Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer
```html
<button></button>
```
This button has no specified type attribute, so its default behavior is to act as a button control with no specific action associated with it. When clicked, it doesn't trigger any default action. 

```html
<button type="submit"></button>
```
This button has a type attribute of "submit." Its default behavior is to submit the form that it is contained within. If it is not inside a form, it will not do anything by default. 

```html
<button type="reset"></button>
```
This button has a type attribute of "reset." Its default behavior is to reset the form, reverting all input fields back to their initial values. If it is not inside a form, it will not do anything by default. 

```html
<button type="button"></button>
```
This button has a type attribute of "button." Its default behavior is to act as a button control with no specific action associated with it. When clicked, it doesn't trigger any default action unless if there is a specified custom JavaScript behavior.

Great job! The only one you missed is the first one, since it is a button, the default behavior will be to submit!
